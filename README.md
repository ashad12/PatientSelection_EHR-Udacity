# PatientSelection_EHR-Udacity
This is the second project in fulfilment of the **AI for Healthcare** *Udacity Nanodegree*. This project focuses on the patient data (EHR) to propose a predictive model that identifies which type of patients may be selected for a drug test. Target patients are likely to be in the hospital for the particular test duration, though will not incur significant additional costs for drug administering and monitoring.
